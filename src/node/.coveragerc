# Minimum coverage thresholds
# Previous: 74.45%
# Current: 76.57% (+2.12 points from target detection analysis tests)
# Scanner modules (expanded coverage):
# - ethoscope_scanner.py: 65.30% coverage (77 tests, +45 new tests)
#   Improved from 32.19% with comprehensive coverage of:
#   - Device control operations (start, stop, poweroff, reboot)
#   - Device information retrieval (connected_module, images, logs)
#   - Streaming functionality (relay_stream manager lifecycle)
#   - Backup filename logic (priority-based selection with fallbacks)
#   - SSH authentication (success, failure, timeout handling)
#   - Device state management (coming online, unreachable states)
#   - Scanner device management (add, ID changes, retirement)
# - ethoscope_streaming.py: 95.38% coverage (44 tests)
#   Improved from 12.72% with comprehensive coverage of:
